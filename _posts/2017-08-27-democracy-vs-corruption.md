Democratic corruption is when an elected leader betrays their responsibilities, enriching themselves or close allies instead of serving their constituents.

Unfortunately, most Americans consistently report perceiving [widespread government corruption](http://www.gallup.com/poll/185759/widespread-government-corruption.aspx):

### Is corruption widespread throughout the government in this country, or not?

We have an intuitive sense that money buys influence.

According to author Lee Drutman ([The Business of America is Lobbying](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190215514.001.0001/acprof-9780190215514)), private interests not only sense that money buys influence, they act on it:

> “For every dollar spent on lobbying by labor unions and public-interest groups together, large corporations and their associations now spend $34.” ([source](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/04/how-corporate-lobbyists-conquered-american-democracy/390822/))

And if you think this is a partisan issue, you're wrong:

### Is all that money having any effect?

It would appear so, per results like the infamous [2014 Princeton Study](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746):

### What is the cost of corruption?

On top of the direct economic loss to the taxpayer via crony handouts, researchers identify [dire second-order effects](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1605.pdf):

> **Corruption can undermine the state's ability to deliver inclusive economic growth in a
number of different areas.** When government functions are impaired, it can adversely affect a
number of important determinants of economic performance, including macro financial stability,
investment, human capital accumulation, and total factor productivity. Moreover, when systemic
corruption affects virtually all state functions, distrust of government can become so pervasive that it
can lead to violence, civil strife, and conflict, with devastating social and economic implications.

### But a liquid democratic legislature could be orders-of-magnitude more resistant to corruption

Think about it like this:

1. Right now, we have only 535 elected legislators for the entire United States (100 Senate + 435 House).

1. Let's assume, just for a simple example, that buying enough influence to tip one member's vote costs $50,000 an issue.

1. That means that in order to "[capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)" a majority of the legislature, it would cost `(535 / 2) * 50,000` = `$13,375,000`.

Now contrast that with a liquid democratic system, which can scale to include thousands of times as many active participants.

If the number of active legislators goes up by a few orders of magnitude, so does the cost of capturing a majority of them.

And remember, liquid democracy includes real accountability. If your chosen delegates no longer seem to represent your interests, you can replace them immediately.

------------

Still, one may wonder if having many more decision makers might make it easier for nefarious deals to slip through the cracks. But stop and think about it compared to our current system. Would it really be easier to organize blatant political corruption at this scale? More cost effectively?

Not even close.

Sure, deep pocketed influencers might hypothetically be able to buy off a few financially desperate voters.

But right now, our 535 legislators each represent an average of 600,000 constituents, so the cost per voter would have to be 600,000 times less than what a current legislator gets.

In other words, a member of Congress would have to sell out for no less than $600,000 today, whereas every regular citizen would need to be convinced for less than $1. And that's just to break even.

And all of this is supposed to happen, at scale, without leaving massive amounts of evidence? [Both briber and bribee would still be breaking the law, facing fines up to $10,000 per instance, and jail time.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/597)

### Liquid democracy can have a massive impact towards ridding ourselves of corruption.
