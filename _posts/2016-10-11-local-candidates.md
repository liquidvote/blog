# Why Local Candidates Should Partner With Liquid Democracy

1. Additional marketing for them and their campaigns.
1. Seriously, actually, tangibly listening to their districts. They all say on their websites that they’re the right choice because they listen to the people… now they can prove it.
1. Help initiate this process that can improve National and State politics as well.
1. Strengthening democracy overall:
  - Involving more people in the process
  - Bringing in more of the reasonable middle ground. instead of just the very vocal extremes that dominate when it’s costly to participate.
  - Giving the people a chance to do democracy more than once every 4 years.
  - Shift the attention from personalities back to issues.
1. Historical significance. “You could be the first Liquid Democracy candidate in history”
