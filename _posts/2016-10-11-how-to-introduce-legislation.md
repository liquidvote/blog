## How to propose new legislation

A skeptical question:

#### How to propose new legislation in a Liquid Democracy

1. **Write up a bill to propose it as legislation. **

Use existing tools like Microsoft Word and Powerpoint. Use things like collaborative Google Docs, [chatrooms](chatrooms) (& [video](https://appear.in)), [powerful revision control management](https://github.com) (git).

Look to the [billions of $$$ open-source work](http://lemire.me/blog/2014/04/14/the-financial-value-of-open-source-software/) as inspiration. All volunteer time, dedicated to making our environments more pleasant to spend time in.

(When you give people the tools, they will make a difference.)


2. **Convince your district to support the legislation. 50% + 1**


3. **Your remote control politician introduces the proposed legislation**, and your district champions it to other districts as a good idea.


4. Then you follow existing rules. **If 50% + 1 of the other districts vote yea, the bill becomes law.**


If people want to participate in political questions (the affairs of the city), they can now choose to. Or they [can pick their most trusted confidant](http://blog.liquid.vote/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) — most trusted representative — and put the system on autopilot.


If people don’t agree to legislation, how is it fair to subject them to it? If you can’t even get half the group to agree it’s a good idea… should the [vast majority](https://fixingtao.com/2016/04/lets-end-hotdog-worship-in-america/) of people be bound by it?
