Our democracy could serve us exponentially better.

Liquid democracy is a 21st-century upgrade for democratic decision making.

It blends the best of direct and representative systems into a more authentic and practical combination.

---------

Originally, we had **direct democracy**, when everyone could vote on all legislation. Lincoln's [“government by the people”](https://youtu.be/BvA0J_2ZpIQ?t=2m13s).

Its history goes back to ancient Athens, and inspired America's founding Declaration that "All men are created equal".

But direct democracy is not practical at scale: how does everyone stay educated and up-to-date on everything?

There's just too much to keep up with.

And so we elect dedicated political **representatives**.

Instead of expecting everyone to know the ins-and-outs of policy, we give the work to a small number of legislators.

535 in our country of over 300,000,000.

**This helps, but introduces new [problems](/assets/article_images/2016-09-21-what-is-liquid-democracy/congressional-approval-history.png):**

1. We may disagree with & distrust our limited choice of candidates.
2. We're often stuck with electoral campaigns dominated more by personality than policy.
3. Perhaps worst of all, once elected, politicians can become huge targets for corruption, with little accountability. [Even the President admits this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4tHW9_bb08).

#### Liquid democracy can solve all three problems.

### How does it work?

#### Direct Voting

Every person can vote for or against every piece of legislation.

Instead of calling your reps to ask them to vote your way, you can do it yourself.

#### Proxying

You can also empower trusted representatives to vote when you’re not able to.

Unlike an electoral system, these are *personal representatives*.

Any time you don't vote on a piece of legislation, the liquid democracy platform looks up how your personal representatives voted and automatically adopts their position.

You can select any legal resident of your jurisdiction. The people you already know and trust, and many more wise individuals, suddenly become options to represent you.

#### A Network of Trust

In a liquid democracy, voting power passes transitively, from one person to the next. This means that if you pick your close friend Sam, and they proxy to their smart coworker Alex, Alex can vote for all three of you.

This allows for a network of much closer connections, rewarding the most trusted people.

Your reps don't need to vote on everything, because they have their own trusted representatives. Each step can make the network smarter, until it reaches someone who feels informed enough about the issue to vote.

This is key. Networks can flourish at scale.

#### No More Elections, More Accountability

With a liquid democratic legislature, you no longer need elections.

Right now, we run expensive elections to take the pulse of the electorate. These are supposed to keep politicians accountable.

But in a liquid democracy, you don't have to wait. You can remove a personal representative at any time, for immediate accountability.

It's your voice. You stay in control. You don't need to give it up for years.

#### Proportional Representation

Currently, a candidate only has to get 51% of the vote, but they go to the legislature to represent 100% of the district.

These winner-take-all elections [entrench a polarizing two-party landscape](/2017/03/06/how-to-move-past-two-parties/).

But in a liquid democracy, when 51% of voters choose the same representative, exactly 51% of the voting power flows to them. And alternative candidates keep a voice proportional to their supporters.

Liquid democracy can include many more perspectives than our electoral process allows.

### Now what?

By adopting liquid democracy, we can empower our most trustworthy leaders, give ourselves true choice and accountability, and transform our politics and society.

We're creating technology to allow liquid democracy at the local, state, and national level. And [we can do it without legal changes](/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/) like a constitutional amendment.
