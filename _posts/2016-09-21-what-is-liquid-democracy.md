Liquid democracy is a 21st-century evolution of democratic decision making. It blends the best of direct and representative systems into an authentic and practical combination.

Direct democracy means everyone can vote on every issue. It’s a true “government by the people”, as Lincoln spoke of, where everyone's voice is equal.

Its history goes back to ancient Athens, and inspired the Founding Fathers of the United States.

But direct democracy is not always practical: how does everyone stay educated and up-to-date on everything? We live busy lives.

Our current solution is to elect dedicated representatives. Instead of expecting everyone to know the ins-and-outs of policy, we hand over the work to a small number of full-time representatives.

This alleviates the issue of not enough time to stay informed, but [introduces new problems](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180113/2014-approval-congress-remains-near-time-low.aspx):

- Citizens feel limited by their choices in candidates, who may not represent their real political views.
- Winner-take-all elections entrench a polarizing two-party system.
- And perhaps worst of all, the need for extreme fundraising corrupts bought out politicians. Skeptical? Even President Donald Trump [famously explained during a national debate how quid-pro-quo campaign finance has broken our political system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4tHW9_bb08).

Liquid democracy aims to solve all this, and to offer the best of both systems.

#### Delegation

In a liquid democracy, you pick a trusted delegate to represent you when you’re not able to.

Unlike our electoral system, a delegate is a *personal* representative.

By default, your delegate can vote for you on each piece of legislation, but you can manually override them anytime to vote directly when you feel informed.

#### Real Options

Unlike traditional elections, you can select *any* legal resident of your jurisdiction to be your delegate. You’re not limited to binary choices on a ballot. And your delegate doesn’t have to quit their job to campaign.

The people you already know and trust, and so many more wise individuals, suddenly become options to represent you.

#### A Network of Trust

Voting power passes transitively, from one person to the next. This means that if you entrust your vote to your close friend John, and he delegates to his smart coworker Tom, Tom can vote for all three of you. This creates a network of close connections, rewarding the most trusted people.

This is key to liquid democracy. Networks of trust allow it to flourish at scale.

#### Representation & Accountability

Unlike traditional elections, liquid democracy is not winner-take-all. In electoral democracy, even when a candidate wins only 51% of the electorate’s vote, they’re supposed to represent 100% of their constituents.

Independent political movements must centralize, else risk going home with nothing. Winner-take-all elections [entrench a two-party landscape](/2017/03/06/how-to-move-past-two-parties/).

In liquid democracy, when 51% of voters choose the same delegate, 51% of the voting power flows to that delegate. And their “rival candidates” still get a voice equivalent to their earned votes.

#### No More Elections

But there are actually no “candidates” because in liquid democracy, there are no elections.

Right now, we [run massive elections](https://twitter.com/dsernst/status/845566576245927936) every few years to take the pulse of the electorate. But in liquid democracy, you can [change your personal delegate](/assets/article_images/2016-09-21-what-is-liquid-democracy/see-you-in-4-years.png) at any time, for immediate accountability.

#### tl;dr

By adopting liquid democracy, we could empower our most trustworthy leaders, give ourselves true choice and accountability, and transform our politics and society.

##### Thank you for reading.

We plan to bring liquid democracy to the United States, and we've found a way that doesn’t require constitutional amendments.
