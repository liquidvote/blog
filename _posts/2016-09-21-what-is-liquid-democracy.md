Liquid democracy is a 21st-century innovation for democratic decision making. It blends the best of direct and representative systems into an authentic and practical combination.

Direct democracy is when everyone can vote on every piece of legislation. It’s Lincoln's “government by the people”, where everyone's voice is equal.

The history of direct democracy goes back to ancient Athens, and inspired the Founding Fathers of the United States.

But direct democracy is not always practical: how does everyone stay educated and up-to-date on everything? We live busy lives.

Our current solution is to elect dedicated representatives. Instead of expecting everyone to know the ins-and-outs of policies being voted upon, we hand over the work to a small number of full-time representatives.

This alleviates the issue of not enough time to stay informed, but [introduces new problems](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180113/2014-approval-congress-remains-near-time-low.aspx):

- Citizens feel limited by their choices in candidates, who may not represent their real political views.
- Winner-take-all elections entrench a polarizing two-party system.
- And perhaps worst of all, elections centralize power, creating massive targets for corruption. ([Even our President admits this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4tHW9_bb08))

Liquid democracy aims to solve all this, offering the best of both worlds.

### How does it work?

#### Delegation

In a liquid democracy, you pick a trusted delegate to represent you when you’re not able to.

Unlike our electoral system, a delegate is a *personal* representative.

By default, your delegate can vote for you on each piece of legislation, but you can override them to vote directly anytime.

#### No More Elections

In a liquid democratic legislature, you no longer need elections.

Right now, we [run massive elections](https://twitter.com/dsernst/status/845566576245927936) to take the pulse of the electorate. These are meant to keep politicians accountable. But in liquid democracy, you don't have to wait. You can [change your personal representative](/assets/article_images/2016-09-21-what-is-liquid-democracy/see-you-in-4-years.png) at any time, for immediate accountability.

It's your voice, why shouldn't you be in charge of it?

#### Real Options

Unlike traditional elections, you can select *any* legal resident of your jurisdiction to be your delegate. You’re not limited to the two frontrunner choices to make your vote count. And your delegate doesn’t have to quit their job to campaign.

The people you already know and trust, and so many more wise individuals, suddenly become options to represent you in government.

#### A Network of Trust

In a liquid democracy, voting power passes transitively, from one person to the next. This means that if you entrust your vote to your close friend John, and he delegates to his smart coworker Tom, Tom can vote for all three of you.

This creates a network of much closer connections, rewarding the most trusted people.

This is the key innovation in liquid democracy. Networks flourish at scale.

#### Proportional Representation

This also lets us escape winner-take-all politics.

Currently in the US, a candidate may win only 51% of the vote, but they go to the legislature to represent 100% of the electorate.

These winner-take-all elections [entrench a two-party landscape](/2017/03/06/how-to-move-past-two-parties/).

But in liquid democracy, when 51% of voters choose the same delegate, exactly 51% of the voting power flows to them. And alternative candidates keep a voice proportional to their supporters.

### Now what?

By adopting liquid democracy, we could empower our most trustworthy leaders, give ourselves true choice and accountability, and transform our politics and society.

We're creating technology to allow liquid democracy at the local, state, and national level in the US. And we think we can do it without any legal changes like constitutional amendments.
