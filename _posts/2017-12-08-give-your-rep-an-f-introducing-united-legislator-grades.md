Right now, Americans concerned about something happening in Washington are often instructed to "Call Your Representatives".

Although it's well intended, there are some problems with this tactic.

There's very little transparency about how many people reach out and where the district as a whole stands on the issues.

The total numbers aren't officially published. Sometimes a rep's office chooses to share them, but this isn't required.

And they have little incentive to, especially if they're *not listening* to their constituents, since it would only make them look bad.

#### We can bring this transparency

[United Vote](/2017/11/06/announcing-united-vote/) lets each American vote on every item in Congress.

Since we verify our members' identities and locations, we can now generate a **score** of how well a legislator is listening to or ignoring their own constituents, for each legislative item.

Here's an example:

![](/assets/article_images/2017-12-08-give-your-rep-an-f-introducing-united-legislator-grades/example-voting-record-score.png)

In this case, the elected rep voted ***against*** [HR1 - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://united.vote/l/us115-hr1), matching 87% of their verified constituents on United.

This can bring much needed transparency and accountability to our legislative process.

#### Can we create an overall score?

We want to make it easy for everyone to know how well their elected legislators are representing their constituents.

Per bill scores is a good start, but it may not be quick enough for the typical busy American.

So we'll combine all the bills together into a single Representation Score for each legislator.

For example: "**This past month, your representative voted with their constituents 74% of the time.**"

We're using the same formula as above, but adding up **all** the legislators' votes with & against their district, across all bills.

Bills that get more votes from constituents are automatically weighted greater than those that attract less attention.

#### Selection bias

There's still a big issue: these scores only represent the people already signed up and verified on United.

We still have a long way to go before everyone's joined United. Until then, our earliest adopters won't necessarily be a representative sample of the electorate at large.

If United is dominated by one group, it would be too easy for people to dismiss these scores.

But [liquid democracy](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) is too big an idea to let that deter us.

So we're going one step farther.

    }
  }
  @media (max-width: 370px) {
    .legislator-grade-scale {
      width: 105px !important;
      margin-top: 5px !important;
    }
  }
</style>

#### Grading on a curve

We want to encourage our legislators to listen to their constituents.

So we'll take their single Representation Score, and grade legislators *against each other*, on a curve.

Those who most listen to their constituents will get an **A+**. Those who most ignore their constituents will get an **F**.

See the chart to the right for the specific breakdowns by percentile.

And we can do this for each party independently. Republican scores separate from Democrats. This means that any red vs blue bias on United gets cancelled out.

We'll publish and share these grades weekly, monthly, and per legislative session.

#### Divide and Conquer

Too often the message from politicians sounds like:

> "The other side are crooks and liars. Vote us into office, or else they'll do terrible things to you. Never criticize us, or else you’re helping the enemy!"

But this *same story* is [being told](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-liberal-and-a-conservative/answer/Samantha-Bean-7?srid=tOBx) on both sides. Good vs evil; us vs them.

Even if a politician sincerely starts out with the best of intentions, they're incentivized to further divide us to gain more power. Although they never admit it, the Republicans need the Democrats, and the Democrats need the Republicans. It’s a vicious cycle we’re stuck in.

But now, the story can change.

Grading our elected legislators is the first step in turning the tables around.

And by grading them on a curve, elected legislators can become much more motivated to one-up each other, even within their own party.

They ought to do their best to represent their constituents as a whole, the way we actually want to be represented.

United can provide an easy metric for voters to hold representatives accountable. The worst offenders risk an election challenge.

#### Starting today, join us.

If you want to be actively involved, United lets you vote directly on legislation, just like you're a Member of Congress.

Since few of us would vote on every bill even if we had the time, United also lets you select personal representatives to vote on your behalf, for legislation you don't vote on directly. Empower the people you trust to help represent your voice.

Every vote cast and personal representative chosen gets us one step closer to a truly representative Congress.

As we grow in numbers, we'll be able to run and elect a new type of legislator — [Liquid Democracy Candidates](/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/) — pledged to vote on *every* bill according their districts' liquid democracy.

This is all part of our plan to make liquid democracy possible, in a grassroots way, without waiting on Congress to pass a new law or Constitutional amendment.

So join us. [Sign up](https://united.vote/join) today, if you haven't already.
