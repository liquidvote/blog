### You deserve more of a voice in Congress.

Our elections offer limited options dominated more by personalities than real policy debate.

The massive costs to campaign, combined with "[pick the lesser of two evils](/2017/03/06/how-to-move-past-two-parties/)" voting rules, create an environment ripe for [corruption](/2017/10/23/democracy-vs-corruption/).

For decades now, our country has only [grown more divided](/assets/article_images/2017-11-06-announcing-united-vote/polarization-over-time.png).

### We can turn this around.

We can create a better way.

**United.vote** uses [liquid democracy](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) to provide a simple process for all Americans to have their voice heard on every bill before Congress.

To get started, you simply sign up at [www.united.vote](https://liquid.us) and [verify your identity](https://liquid.us/verification/identity).

### Personalized Representation

United allows you to vote for or against any Congressional bill.

But since few of us have time to research most bills, United lets you name personal representatives to vote in your place when you don't.

You can pick anyone - from a politician to a celebrity to your next door neighbor.

And your representatives can pick their own trusted representatives, creating a network of trust to find the best experts on every bill, while still being accountable to you, the voter.

### Join us

United **grades** every Legislator based on how well they truly represent their constituents.

We can make it transparent when they don't listen.

This can help Congress more closely follow the will of the people, or risk [someone running against them who will](/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/).

This means we can start to build a better democracy right now, without waiting on a constitutional amendment.

This can help us address the many problems facing our country, so that we can build a republic stronger than ever before.

> Our Founding Fathers, here in this country, brought about the only true revolution that has ever taken place in man’s history. Every other revolution simply exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. But only here did that little band of men so advanced beyond their time that the world has never seen their like since, evolve the idea that you and I have within ourselves the God-given right and the ability to determine our own destiny.
