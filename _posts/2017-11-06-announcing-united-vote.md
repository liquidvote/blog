Do you ever wish you had more of a voice in Congress?

Right now, elections are the only legal way to make our voices heard. But too many of our politicians treat these as a game to be won by stagecraft, manipulation, and fear-mongering, rather than a forum to debate our values and policies.

This has led to an era of political dysfunction seemingly without end. Despite consensus among voters on many issues, our legislative process goes nowhere.

The divisive and costly nature of elections seems to only make things worse.

But, together, we can build a better way.

[United Vote](https://united.vote), launching nationwide today, uses [liquid democracy](https://blog.united.vote/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) to provide a simple process for all Americans to have their voice heard on every bill before Congress.

To get started, you simply sign up at [united.vote](https://united.vote), choose people you trust to represent you, and verify your identity with a $1 charge to a credit card in your name.

Once you’re signed up, United allows you to vote for or against any Congressional bill.

But since few of us have time to research most bills, United lets you name personal representatives to vote in your place when you don't.

You can pick anyone - from Paul Ryan to Oprah Winfrey to your next door neighbor. And your representatives can delegate to their own trusted representatives, creating a chain of trust to find the best experts on every bill, while still being accountable to you, the voter.

And since United verifies the identity of every voter, we then can grade every members of Congress based on how well they truly represent their constituents, transparently alerting everyone when they fail to do so.

This can force members of Congress to more closely follow the will of their electorate, or risk [someone running against them who will](https://blog.united.vote/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/).

We can start to build a better democracy *today*, without changing a single law.

We hope that liquid democracy can help us address many of the problems facing our country, so that we can build a republic stronger and more inclusive than ever before.

Please [reach out](mailto:help@united.vote) with any questions, concerns, or support. We'd love to hear from you.

> Our Founding Fathers, here in this country, brought about the only true revolution that has ever taken place in man’s history. Every other revolution simply exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. But only here did that little band of men so advanced beyond their time that the world has never seen their like since, evolve the idea that you and I have within ourselves the God-given right and the ability to determine our own destiny.
