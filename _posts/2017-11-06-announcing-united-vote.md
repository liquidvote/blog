### You deserve more of a voice in Congress.

Right now, elections are our only legal way to participate.

But elections invite a game of stagecraft: limited options dominated more by personalities than policy.

And the massive costs to campaign, combined with "pick the [lesser of two evils](/2017/03/06/how-to-move-past-two-parties/)" election rules, create an environment ripe for [corruption](/2017/10/23/democracy-vs-corruption/).

For decades now, our country has only grown more [divided](/assets/article_images/2017-11-06-announcing-united-vote/polarization-over-time.png).

#### We can turn this around.

We can create a better way.

United.vote uses [liquid democracy](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) to provide a simple process for all Americans to have their voice heard on every bill before Congress.

To get started, you simply sign up at [www.united.vote](https://united.vote) and verify your identity with a $1 charge to a credit card in your name. ([Why?](https://united.vote/verification/identity))

### Join Us

United allows you to vote for or against any Congressional bill.

But since few of us have time to research most bills, United lets you name personal representatives to vote in your place when you don't.

You can pick anyone - from a celebrity or politician, to your next door neighbor.

And your representatives can pick their own trusted representatives, creating a chain of trust to find the best experts on every bill, while still being accountable to you, the voter.

### Personalized Representation

United can [grade](/2017/12/08/give-your-rep-an-f-introducing-united-legislator-grades/) every Member of Congress based on how well they truly represent their constituents.

We can make it transparent when they fail to listen.

This can force Congress to more closely follow the will of the people, or risk [someone running against them who will](/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/).

This means we can start to build a better democracy *today*, without changing a single law. So [join us](https://united.vote/join).

This can help us address many of the problems facing our country, so that we can build a republic stronger and more inclusive than ever before.

Please reach out — [**support@united.vote**](mailto:support@united.vote) — with any questions, concerns, or support. We'd love to hear from you.

> Our Founding Fathers, here in this country, brought about the only true revolution that has ever taken place in man’s history. Every other revolution simply exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. But only here did that little band of men so advanced beyond their time that the world has never seen their like since, evolve the idea that you and I have within ourselves the God-given right and the ability to determine our own destiny.
