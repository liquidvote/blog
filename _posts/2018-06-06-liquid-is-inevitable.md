In the future, a [liquid majority](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) will seek consensus among the greatest number of people, on every issue.

We're still early, but how much longer can we expect a single person to best represent [***700,000***](/2017/04/11/lets-end-hotdog-worship-in-america/) of us?

#### Viral growth

Each of us is incentivized to recruit new people.

*For example:*

> **Goto [united.vote/david](https://united.vote/david) and Proxy to me**

This increases my voting power & influence.

You can do it too.

[We all can](https://united.vote/join).

How can any individual politician hope to compete?

#### Liquid democracy is mathematically inevitable.

Healthier democracy here we come.
