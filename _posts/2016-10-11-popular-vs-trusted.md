# Would you rather be led by the most popular, or the most trusted?

Right now we choose our legislators by who's the most popular. Liquid Democracy means a shift to who's the most trusted.

Our politicians campaign by getting their faces on yard-signs and TV. They're more like celebrities than trusted representatives. You might know their name, but how often do they know yours?

How often have you discussed with your representatives the issues you're passionate towards? Have you ever stayed up late into the night talking with them about the problems you care most about?

Liquid Democracy means you're never again forced to give away your democratic representation to someone you've never met.

Who would you ask to make decisions for you when you're not around? Who are your smartest friends? Most insightful role models? The people who always have your back?

Liquid Democracy lets you choose *them* as delegates.
