You could sort Americans into two groups: people who pay a lot of attention to politics, and those who don't. It seems like most people fall into the second group.

[Liquid democracy](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) is appealing to those who spend a lot of time following politics, but it's also easier for those who aren't all that involved.

### "Rock The Vote"

In our current world, there's social pressure to go to the polling booth every election. And each time, it's your "civic duty" to research the candidates to make the best choice.

After all, that lawmaker will be in power for the next few years. Even if you didn't vote, they still "represent" you.

### Liquid democracy does away with this idea.

One big difference is there's no more need for once-every-4-year legislative elections. Once you've found someone you respect, you can stick with them as long as you like.

More importantly, liquid democracy isn't winner-take-all, so there's no pressure to stop a bad candidate from taking office and representing the entire district.

And lastly, you don't have to leave your home to get involved. You can take part in your liquid democracy online or from your phone.

This all adds up to make a more convenient democracy than what we have today.
