# Don't care about politics?

## Liquid Democracy is easier for you too

You could sort Americans into two types: people who pay attention to politics, and those who don't. It seems like 9 out of 10 are in the second group.

There are all sorts of reasons how Liquid Democracy can improve your life if you care about politics, but it's important to also show how it makes things easier for those who just aren't all that interested.

### Rock The Vote

In our current world, citizens are expected to go to the polling booth at least every 4 years, and really every 2. And for each election, it's your "civic duty" to research the candidates to make the best choice. After all, you're going to be stuck with that lawmaker for the next few years. And even if you don't vote, they still "represent" you.

### Liquid Democracy does away with this idea.

The first big difference is that there aren't once-every-4-year elections. Once you've found someone you like, you can stick with them as long as you like.

More importantly, Liquid Democracy isn't winner-take-all, so there's no pressure to stop a bad candidate from taking office and representing the entire district.

And lastly, Liquid Democracy is managed through the digital devices already in your pocket. So when you want to participate, you don't even have to leave your home.

All of this adds up to make it a more convenient way to do democracy than what we have today.
