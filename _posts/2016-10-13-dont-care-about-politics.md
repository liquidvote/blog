You could sort Americans into two groups: people who pay a lot of attention to politics, and those who don't. Many people fall into the latter.

[Liquid democracy](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) is appealing to those who spend a lot of time following politics, but it's also easier for those who don't want to be all that involved.

### "Rock The Vote"

In our current world, there's social pressure to go to the polling booth every election. And each time, it's your "civic duty" to research the candidates to make the best choice.

After all, that lawmaker will be in power for the next few years. Even if you didn't vote, they still "represent" you.

### Liquid democracy removes these requirements.

Liquid democracy isn't winner-take-all, so there's no pressure to stop a bad candidate from taking office and representing the entire district.

In fact, in a complete liquid democracy, there's no need for once-every-4-year legislative elections. Once you've found someone you trust, you could stick with them as long as you like.

And, when you do want to be involved, you don't even have to leave your home. You could vote right from your phone or a computer.

We can create a better political process, and still make it easier for the busiest among us.
