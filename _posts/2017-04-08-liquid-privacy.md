MATT:
You know what comes to mind? Anonymity in voting.
A feature of voting that I forget is that it's validated through registration.
But it's anonymous at the point of power.


DAN:
Yeah, Liquid is anonymous voting.


MATT:
And anonymous delegation?


DAN:
Mostly anonymous delegation.


MATT:
So to be delegated to...
Means removing anonymity?


DAN:
No one else can see who you delegate to.


MATT:
Good.


DAN:
Before you can delegate to someone, they must approve.
If they do, since they now represent you,
you can see all their votes.


MATT:
That's how it should be.


DAN:
Both sides can stop the relationship without the other finding out.


MATT:
So in that case, identity is voting history?


DAN:
Yes. You can only see their votes while they approve being your rep.
They can take that away anytime.


MATT:
Makes sense.


DAN:
And for all the votes you inherit from your rep...
You don't know whether they voted directly or got their vote from their own rep.


MATT:
Hah I really like this.


DAN:
You only need a little bit of content and it can drive a very large community.
Each vote spreads virally.
That can get exponential real fast.
6 degrees of separation.


MATT:
Yeah. At scale.
I'm having my mind blown a little bit though.
