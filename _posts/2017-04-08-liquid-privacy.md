Matt:
  You know what comes to mind? Anonymity in voting.
  A feature of voting that I forget is that it's validated through
  registration.
  But it's anonymous at the point of power.


Dan:
  Yeah, Liquid is anonymous voting.


Matt:
  And anonymous delegation?
  The non-anonymous parties in voting are the candidates.


Dan:
  Mostly anonymous delegation.


Matt:
  So to be delegated to...
  Means removing anonymity?


Dan:
  No one else can see who you delegated to.
  When you delegate to someone for the first time, they have to approve.
  If they approve the request, you can see all their votes.
  Both sides can stop the relationship without the other finding out.


Matt:
  So in that case, identity is voting history?


Dan:
  You can only see their votes while they approve delegation to you.
  They can take that away anytime.
  And for all the votes that are delegated to you...
  You don't know whether your delegate voted directly or if they
  received the vote from their own delegate.


Matt:
  Hah I really like this.


Dan:
  You really only need a little bit of content
  And it can power a very large community.
  Each vote spreads virally.
  That can get exponential real fast.
  Think 6 degrees of separation.


Matt:
  Yeah. At scale.
  I'm having my mind blown a little bit though.
