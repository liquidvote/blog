MATT:

You know what comes to mind? Anonymity in voting.
A feature of voting that I forget is that it's validated through registration.
But it's anonymous at the point of power.


DAN:

Yeah, Liquid is anonymous voting.


MATT:

And anonymous delegation?


DAN:

Mostly anonymous delegation.


MATT:

So to be delegated to...
Means removing anonymity?


DAN:

No one else can see who you delegate to.
Before you can delegate to someone, they must approve.
If they do, you can see all their votes.
Because they now represent you.
Both sides can stop the relationship without the other finding out.


MATT:

So in that case, identity is voting history?


DAN:

You can only see their votes while they approve being your rep.
They can take that away anytime.
And for all the votes you inherit from your delegate...
You don't know whether they voted directly or got their vote from their own delegate.


MATT:

Hah I really like this.


DAN:

You really only need a little bit of content and it can power a very large community.
Each vote spreads virally.
That can get exponential real fast.
Think 6 degrees of separation.


MATT:

Yeah. At scale.
I'm having my mind blown a little bit though.
