title: "Liquid Democracy Candidates: How To Upgrade Our Legislature, One Seat at a Time"

We’re at a critical moment in politics, when an unprecedented numbers of people express frustration at the status quo. There has been demand from left, right, and center for new ways of doing things.

Liquid democracy is the most promising alternative. ([Click here for a reminder why](http://intro.liquid.vote).)

And yet the most common refrain is that it would be too unlikely to make such a change, because it must require a constitutional amendment.

But this is not true.

We have a new option open to us.

## We can use the old system to adopt a new one.

We can run new candidates for office. “Liquid Democracy Candidates”.

These are people who believe in this new way, believe in the mission, and want to give their fellow Americans a true way to represent themselves.

They pledge that if they get elected, they'll vote on each bill according to their district’s liquid democracy.

This could be as simple for them as pressing a button when their name is called to vote on a bill.

Their app could perfectly announce their neighbors’ decision, every time.

##### This person could run on the slogan “Vote for me because I *don’t* want to be a politician”, and actually mean it.

In this way, a single district can now democratically make the decision to upgrade their representative system.

And it only takes 51% of the vote.

## This gives us a way to try out liquid democracy, in the real world, with much less risk.

Imagine a city council with 15 members. A single district could elect a liquid democracy candidate.

Everyone signed up for the Liquid platform could now control one of the legislative votes. The other 14 seats remain the same as before.

##### This gives us a bottoms-up way to try out liquid democracy in the real world, without any legal changes.

This is a much safer way to explore our better options, and with less downside.
