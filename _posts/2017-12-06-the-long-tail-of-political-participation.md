Political capital, the "trust, goodwill, and influence a politician has with the public and other political figures", is most likely distributed along a power law.

Here's a reminder of what a power law distribution looks like:

Massive winners on the top, called the **Head**, and then many more participants with less individual percentages of the whole, called the **Long Tail**.

Power laws show up all over nature, especially in competitive markets like product sales, play counts of songs on the radio, or populations of cities.

And here's what the votes for president has looked like for the last 40 years:

See how each of those individual elections resemble the head of a power law curve?

And that only shows a few political parties.

#### Our current electoral process cuts off the Long Tail.

Significantly, power law distributions found in nature will often have more than half of their total distribution in the Long Tail.

But by awarding 100% of the political power for winning only 51% of the votes, two frontrunners gain a massive handicap. This is better described as a **duopoly**: two outwardly competitive actors with near complete control of the market.

In a country of over 300 million, this leaves most of us out of the conversation.

And we can all too easily observe that not voting — "None of these options are worth my time" — is almost always the most popular choice in our elections. [Sometimes drastically so](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/11/in-the-us-almost-no-one-votes-in-local-elections/505766/).

#### But it doesn't have to be this way.

Amazon unlocked the Long Tail of consumer goods, by creating an online store with infinite shelf space. They never have to say "no room" for any product, even if it's individually not very popular.

One employee famously said, "We sold more books today that didn't sell at all yesterday than we sold today of all the books that did sell yesterday." This gives them a huge advantage over brick and mortar alternatives.

YouTube unlocks the Long Tail of video creators, by giving anyone who signs up a stage and a way to reach their audience.

And consumers sure seem to like it: YouTube is on track to [surpass all of TV's combined viewership numbers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-tops-1-billion-hours-of-video-a-day-on-pace-to-eclipse-tv-1488220851?mod=e2fb).

By replacing electoral representation with personal representation, [liquid democracy](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) can do the same thing for political participation.

Many more people can be included in the legislative process, and less-engaged voters can have more and better options for representation.
