> The most significant fact about this system is the economy of knowledge with which it operates...by a kind of symbol, only the most essential information is passed on. ...The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity...without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to...move in the right direction.

I want to show how the US functions as a top-down planned political economy, how liquid democracy offers an alternative, and how this can improve the public space for everyone.

### We live in a centrally planned democracy

In a democracy, voting is a citizens’ purchasing power. Like the private market, the economy of politics is subject to supply and demand. Politicians are the supply; votes show demand.

But citizens can only vote once every 2 years, limiting the rate of feedback within the system.

On top of that, the nature of our electoral process artificially constrains supply. Voters’ options are limited to those at the top of the ballot, picked by party insiders. And winner-take-all elections means that a vote for anyone other than the front-runners is “wasted”.

#### Size of the signal

The 114th Congress introduced over 10,000 bills in its two year session. Since each can be supported or opposed, that means `2 ^ 10000` (`10 ^ 3000`) possibilities.

And yet for all but the five hundred members of Congress, our vote is basically red or blue, every two years.

Our current democracy reflects the constraints of [the time it was developed](/2017/02/09/why-hasnt-voting-changed/). But our modern age appears to rapidly outpace our government's capacity to respond.

### Liquid democracy lifts these restrictions

[Liquid democracy](https://intro.liquid.vote) uses modern technology to evolve our political process, offering new options for everyone.

Citizens can use the [Liquid platform](https://join.liquid.vote) to directly vote for and against legislation, something previously limited to legislators. Since voting can occur daily, rather than biennially, this massively expands our public space's liquidity.

On top of this, individuals may select *personal* representatives, who can vote on legislation for them. This greatly expands the political economy's supply, since these liquid politicians can be influential even without anywhere close to 50% of their jurisdiction’s vote. They don’t need to quit their jobs, nor even vote directly on all legislation, choosing instead to pass their voting power along to their own personal representatives.

And, this still allows for the options of our current system: a citizen can still choose a single individual to vote on all legislation for them.

### These new options create a smarter democracy

Because it includes so much more signaling information, liquid democracy can create better leaders and more widely supported policies.

Compare the Soviet centrally planned economy, which led to [widespread poverty](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/29/world/soviet-openness-brings-poverty-out-of-the-shadows.html) and [starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921%E2%80%9322), vs free market economies' unprecedented wealth. [Friedrich Hayek was awarded a Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/hayek-facts.html) for showing that by including millions of more participants, each sending their own supply & demand signals, orders of magnitude more peoples' desires can be accommodated.

As a country, we've [unlocked unimaginable wealth in our private sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States#/media/File:U.S._Household_net_worth_graphic.png). But we could be doing so much better in our public life.
