I want to show how the US is directed as a top-down planned political economy, how liquid democracy offers an alternative, and how this can improve the public space for everyone.

### We live in a centrally planned democracy

In a democracy, voting is a citizens’ purchasing power. Like the private market, the economy of politics is subject to supply and demand. Politicians are the supply; votes demonstrate demand.

Unfortunately citizens can only vote once every few years, limiting the rate of feedback within the system.

On top of that, the nature of our electoral process artificially constrains supply. Voters’ options are limited to those at the top of the ballot. Winner-take-all elections means that a vote for anyone other than the front-runners is “wasted”.

### Low resolution signal

The 114th Congress introduced over 10,000 bills in its two year session. Since each can be supported or opposed, that means `2 ^ 10000` (`10 ^ 3000`) different possibilities.

And yet for all but the five hundred members of Congress, our only vote is basically red or blue, every two years.

That's a low quality signal.

### Liquid democracy lifts these restrictions

[Liquid democracy](https://intro.liquid.vote) uses modern technology to evolve our political process, offering new options for everyone.

Citizens can use the [Liquid platform](https://join.liquid.vote) to directly vote for and against legislation, something previously limited to legislators. Since voting can occur daily, rather than every few years, this massively expands our public space's liquidity.

On top of this, individuals may select *personal* representatives, who can vote on legislation for them. This greatly expands the political economy's supply, since these liquid politicians don’t need to get anywhere close to 50% of a jurisdiction’s vote. They don’t need to quit their jobs, nor even vote themselves on legislation, choosing instead to pass their voting power along to their own delegates.

_And_ this still allows for all of the options of our traditional representative system. A citizen can still pick one individual to vote on all legislation for them for 4 years.

### These new options create a smarter democracy

Because it includes so much more signaling information, liquid democracy can pick better leaders and more widely supported policies.

Compare the Soviet centrally planned economy, which led to [widespread poverty](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/29/world/soviet-openness-brings-poverty-out-of-the-shadows.html) and [starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921%E2%80%9322), vs free market economies' unprecedented wealth. History shows that by including millions of more participants, each sending their own supply & demand signals, orders of magnitude more peoples' desires can be accommodated.

As a country, we've [unlocked unimaginable wealth in our private sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States#/media/File:U.S._Household_net_worth_graphic.png). But we could be doing so much better in our public life.
