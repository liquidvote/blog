Direct democracy is now possible, but still impractical.

#### Allowing everyone to weigh in over the internet is attractive, but we still need leaders who understand policy.

[Liquid democracy](https://blog.united.vote/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) offers both.

Vote when you want to; let your personal representatives use your extra vote otherwise.

#### Superior representation.

More [options](/2017/12/18/unlocking-the-long-tail-of-political-participation/). More [accountability](https://blog.united.vote/2017/10/23/democracy-vs-corruption/). Your [own voice](https://blog.united.vote/2017/12/08/give-your-rep-an-f-introducing-united-legislator-grades/).

Your personal council of trusted elders.

#### [United](https://united.vote) makes this possible.
