You've probably been told before to "Call Your Congressman".

Some people say "this is the most effective method".

Unfortunately, that doesn't [mean](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/what-calling-congress-achieves) it's actually effective, just that other ways are *even less* effective.

#### United Vote can make this easier

United lets you vote for or against any bill, on a computer or your phone.

You just press a few buttons. You don't need to wait on hold or leave a voicemail. You can write an optional message if you want.

Here's an [example](link to rep's last 24 hrs of submitted votes) of what this looks like.

#### United also lets you represent your friends

If you're going to call in, you may consider encouraging your friends and family to call in as well.

We can make this much easier.

Rather than needing to encourage them every time, after you create a United Vote account, other people can proxy their vote to you, so that every time you vote on an item, all these people who've said they trust you can also automatically be represented.

They can take-back or override the proxy at any time, without alerting you, so they always stay in control of their voice.

This is based on a concept called [Liquid Democracy](https://blog.united.vote/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/).

#### United can create more accountability

Although this is easier for you, your friends, and your legislators (we automatically count & organize all the votes), there's still a problem... elected representatives can always ignore their constituents' wishes.

Part of the problem is that when you call in, your message often goes into a sort of black hole. No one except them knows that you called, or how many other people did as well.

If they want to ignore you, would they share this information?

#### United can provide this transparency

If you're willing to verify your identity, we can use your votes to score elected legislators for how much they actually listen to their constituents.

[Verification](https://united.vote/verification/identity) requires a $1 one-time charge to a credit or debit card in your name, which helps prevent fake accounts & cover our costs.

We [then grade](https://blog.united.vote/2017/12/08/give-your-rep-an-f-introducing-united-legislator-grades/) all elected Members of Congress against each other, on a curve, for how much they listen & ignore their constituents.

(You can still use United without verifying, and we'll send your votes to your reps, but we can't include unverified votes in the public grades.)

#### But we're often too busy

Just as other people can proxy to you, United lets you proxy your vote to other people.

This can be anyone, from personal associates, to your favorite pundit, to a different politician you trust more.

In fact, you can pick multiple proxies — #1, 2, 3... — each outranking the next, acting like an additional backup so that your views are always represented.

As before, you can always override or replace any of these proxies at any time, so you always stay in control.

#### Creating the foundation for a better democracy

A growing number of us believe this new model, known as [Liquid Democracy](https://blog.united.vote/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/), can create a representative government that is [less susceptible to corruption](https://blog.united.vote/2017/10/23/democracy-vs-corruption/) (goodbye campaign finance problems) and [less polarized](https://blog.united.vote/2017/03/06/how-to-move-past-two-parties/) into two limiting parties.

And if 51% of voters in a district agree, we can [elect new candidates](https://blog.united.vote/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/) who promise to vote on every bill according to their local liquid democracy.

We want to make this easy, [secure](https://secure.united.vote), & trustworthy.

This offers us a path to much needed fundamental reform, without waiting on Congress to first make changes that conflict with their own personal interests.

#### How to help

This vision only goes anywhere if a majority find it better than what we have now.

If it intrigues you, take 30 seconds to enter your email on this [Join page](https://united.vote/join). (We won't share it with anyone.)

We'll give you more instructions, which you can complete now or later, and only send you the rarest major announcements.

#### Towards a more hopeful future

Congress' Approval Ratings have been in the gutters for decades, faith in our institutions has been falling alarmingly, and there's a lot of cynicism all around.

Liquid Democracy — a more representative, accountable, & inclusive government — is one of the most promising solutions.

And our grassroots strategy to realize it offers a massive advantage vs. similar well-intentioned initiatives for systemic reform.

We've only just started. We still have a long way to go. And we'd love for you to join us.
