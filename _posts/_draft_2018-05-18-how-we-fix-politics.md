# How we can fix this political mess we're in.

(Aim for 6 minutes.)

## We're all frustrated.

Politics is in an ugly place. The numbers are very bad. Congressional approval ratings hover around 1 out 10.

This isn't just the last few years, but the last 20 years.

Partisan polarization has been [increasing for a while]().

Many people don't know the names of their representatives.

Trust in government is at all time lows:

Where is American democracy heading?

What's a caring person to do?

## There's a growing movement for an idea called *liquid democracy*, that can get us back in the right direction.

And amazingly, all we have to do now is vote for it.

If you live in Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco or its southern suburbs, you will have the option in our **June 5th primary** to  immediately upgrade to this stronger system.

But I've gotten ahead of myself. What is this all about?

## Democracy for the modern world

American democracy was designed in a different era.

Our current system was a big innovation for 1776, but the 18th century was a drastically different environment.

There was no electricity, no telephones, no telegraphs.

Getting a message from New York to Philadelphia involved writing it out with a quill and delivering it by horseback. That's a 4 day ride, each way.

## Democracy for a larger population

When the Constitution was signed, the entire country had less than 4 million people.

Each representative had only 30,000 constituents.

The Founders thought this number was so important, they [tried to make it the very first Constitutional Amendment](https://1st.united.vote).

Today, our national legislators are expected to represent nearly a million people each.

## A better way?

There are many good ideas for democratic reform.

- Represent.us advocates for [The Anti-Corruption Act](), to change how we fund elections.

- [Thirty-Thousand.org](http://www.thirty-thousand.org/) advocates drastically increasing the number of representatives, like our Founders originally wanted.

- The Center for Election Science advocates using an alternative voting method like [Approval](https://approval.vote/) or [Score](http://www.rangevoting.org/) Voting, to minimize voting paradoxes in the game theory.

- Another popular idea is stricter term limits.

All of these are promising, but they all share a big flaw: *they require a top-down legal change*.

## A strategy inspired by Odysseus

What if we could adopt a stronger representative system, without asking the current powers-that-be for permission?

Enter [*Liquid Candidates*](https://candidates.united.vote). (Or if you prefer: *Trojan Legislator*.)

## Our world has changed.

The technology in our pockets changes everything.

We can message almost anyone in the world, nearly instantly.

We have access to a world encyclopedia, on billions of topics, free and at our fingertips.

But our democratic infrastructure (for *many good reasons*) is mostly based on communication ideas from 200 years ago.

## We want a less corrupt government.


## We want a smarter government.

The whole idea of our current representative system is that we're supposed to pick wiser people to look into the issues and advocate for our values.

But we






This idea is gaining more and more traction:
