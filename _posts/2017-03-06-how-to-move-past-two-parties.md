Many Americans are [fed up](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22two%20party%22&src=typd) with our two-party system. But what can we do about it? Is it written in law?

Not exactly. One cause is media treatment, like inviting only the D and R candidates to debate.

But there's more to it than that. There are major structural reasons for our partisanship.

#### It's in the game theory

Even if a candidate only gets 51% of their district's vote, they still win. Now they speak for 100% of the district, including those who didn't vote for them.

This leads to extra high stake elections. You either win and get it all, or lose and go home with nothing.

No wonder campaigns can become so nasty. No wonder politicians take money from groups they'd otherwise rather not owe favors.

#### A two-party duopoly

Individuals want a voice, but strategy says that picking a third party is "throwing away your vote".

We're pressured to pick *the lesser of two evils*, instead of how we really feel.

Social choice theory [proves](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/) how our election rules entrench a two-party landscape.

#### But a [liquid democratic system](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) is different

Instead of winner-take-all, representation becomes proportional.

51% of support from the electorate means 51% of voting power in the legislature.

Everyone else — minority candidates — can still have a voice.

#### We all become free to choose representatives right for us

Representation is no longer limited to those at the top of the ballot, picked by party elite.

It's foolish to keep pretending there are only two sides. Liquid democracy offers us a way out.

Best of all, thanks to [United](https://united.vote), we can now [transition to liquid democracy](/2017/11/06/announcing-united-vote/) without needing to first pass new laws.
