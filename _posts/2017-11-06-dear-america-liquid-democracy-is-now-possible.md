#### Do you ever wish you had more of a voice in Congress?

Too many of our politicians treat elections, the only way we have to make our voices heard, as a game to be won by stagecraft, manipulation, and fear-mongering rather than a forum to debate our values and policies.

This has led to an era of political dysfunction seemingly without end. Despite consensus among the voters on many issues, legislative consensus is rarely found. The divisive and competitive nature of elections seems to make this worse, not better.

But, together, we can build a better way.

[United Vote](https://united.vote), launching nationwide today, uses [liquid democracy](https://blog.united.vote/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) to provide a simple process for all Americans to have their voice heard on every bill before Congress — without having to research and vote on each bill themselves.

To get started, you simply sign up at [united.vote](https://united.vote), choose people you trust to represent you, and verify your identity.

Once you’re signed up, United allows you to vote for or against any Congressional bill.

However, since few of us have time to research most bills, liquid democracy lets you choose personal representatives to cast your vote when you don’t.

You can name anyone to be your representative - from Elizabeth Warren to Ted Cruz to your next door neighbor. Your representatives can delegate to their own trusted representatives, creating a chain of trust to find the best expert on every bill while still being accountable to you, the voter.

*Check out [this video](https://60.united.vote) to learn more about liquid democracy.*

Since United first verifies the identity of every voter, we can then grade our members of Congress based on how well they truly represent their constituents, transparently alerting everyone when they fail to do so.

This will force members of Congress to more closely follow the will of their constituents or risk [someone running against them who will](https://blog.united.vote/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/).

This means that we can start to build a better democracy *today*, without changing a single law.

We hope that United will help us address the many problems facing our country and allow us to build a democracy that is stronger and more inclusive than ever before.
