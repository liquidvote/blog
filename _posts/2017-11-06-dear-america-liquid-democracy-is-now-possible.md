> Our Founding Fathers, here in this country, brought about the only true revolution that has ever taken place in man’s history. Every other revolution simply exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. But only here did that little band of men so advanced beyond their time that the world has never seen their like since, evolve the idea that you and I have within ourselves the God-given right and the ability to determine our own destiny.

More and more of today’s politicians treat elections, the only way we have to make our voices heard, as a game to be won by stagecraft, manipulation, and fear-mongering rather than a forum to debate our values and policies.

This has led to an era of political dysfunction seemingly without end. Despite consensus among the voters on many issues, legislative consensus is rarely found. The divisive and competitive nature of elections seems to make this worse, not better.

But, together, we can build a better way.

[United Vote](https://united.vote), launching nationwide today, uses [liquid democracy](https://blog.united.vote/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/) to provide a simple process for all Americans to have their voice heard on every bill before Congress — without having to research and vote on each bill themselves.

To get started, you simply sign up at [united.vote](https://united.vote), choose people you trust to represent you, and verify your identity.

Once you’re signed up, United allows you to vote for or against any Congressional bill. However, since none of us will vote on every (or even most) bill, the people you choose as representatives can cast your vote when you don’t.

You can name anyone to be your representative - from Elizabeth Warren to Ted Cruz to your next door neighbor. Your representative can also delegate to another trusted representative if they don’t vote, and so on, creating a chain of trust to find the best expert on every bill while still being accountable to you, the voter.

Check out [this video](https://60.united.vote) to learn more about liquid democracy.

Since United verifies the identity of every voter, we can then grade our members of Congress based on how well they represents their constituents, transparently alerting everyone when they fail to do so.

This will force members of Congress to more closely follow the will of their constituents or risk [someone running against them who will](https://blog.united.vote/2017/07/04/running-liquid-democracy-candidates/) - challengers can even promise to cast their votes in Congress based on the outcome of the votes in this platform.

This means that we can start to build a better democracy today without changing a single law.

We hope that liquid democracy will help get us on the path to solving the many problems facing our political system and allow us to build a democracy that is stronger and more inclusive than ever before.
