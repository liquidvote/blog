We’re at a critical moment in politics, when an unprecedented numbers of people express frustration with the status quo. There has been demand from left, right, and center for new ways of doing things.

Liquid democracy is a promising alternative. Represent yourself, or pick anyone you trust to vote for you in government. ([Read more](https://intro.liquid.vote).)

And yet one of the most common refrains is that it would be too hard to make such a change, because it must require a constitutional amendment.

Not true.

We have a new option open to us.

### We can use the old system to adopt a new one.

We can run new candidates for office. “Liquid Democracy Candidates”.

These are people who believe in this new way, believe in the mission, and want to give their fellow Americans a true way to represent themselves.

Imagine a city council with 15 members. A liquid democracy candidate could campaign for one of the seats. The other 14 remain the same as before.

They pledge that if they get elected, they'll vote on each bill according to their district’s liquid democracy.

This could be as easy as pressing a button when their name is called to vote on a bill. Their app could perfectly announce their district’s decision, every time:

> Speaker: "Representative Jones, how do you vote?"
>
> (Holding their phone up to the microphone): "The people of district 5 vote NAY!"

In this way, a single district can now democratically choose to [upgrade their representation](/2017/10/27/liquid-democracy-is-not-direct-democracy/). And it only takes 51% of the voters in that district.

**This gives us a grassroots way to try out liquid democracy in the real world, without any legal changes, and much less risk than a top-down amendment.**
