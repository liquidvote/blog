We’re at a critical political moment, when an unprecedented number of people express frustration with the status quo. There's demand from left, right, and center for new ways of doing things.

**Liquid democracy** is a promising alternative: the option to vote directly on policy, plus personalized representation. Empower *anyone* you trust to represent you when you don't vote yourself. ([Learn more](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/).)

When first learning about liquid democracy, many people often say something like:

> "This sounds great. But it must be too hard to make happen. It will be decades before we can pass a constitutional amendment."

Right. But we have a new option open to us.

### We use the old system to adopt a new one.

We can run new candidates for office. "***Liquid Democracy Candidates***”.

These are people who believe in LD's potential, and want to give their neighbors a better way to represent themselves.

Imagine a city council with 15 members. A liquid candidate campaigns for just one of the seats. The other 14 remain the same as before.

A liquid candidate pledges that if elected, they'll vote on every bill according to their district’s liquid democracy.

This could be as easy as pressing a button when their name is called to vote. Their app could perfectly announce their district’s decision, every time:

This way, a single district can now democratically choose to [upgrade their representation](/2017/10/27/liquid-democracy-is-not-direct-democracy/). And unlike most reform proposals, it only takes 51% of voters in a single district.

**This gives us a grassroots strategy to bring liquid democracy to our real governments, without any legal changes. And with much lower risk than trying to change the system all at once.**
