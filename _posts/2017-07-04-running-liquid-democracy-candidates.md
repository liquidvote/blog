We’re at a critical moment in politics, when an unprecedented number of people express frustration with the status quo. There has been demand from left, right, and center for new ways of doing things.

Liquid democracy is a promising alternative: the option to vote directly on policy, plus supercharged representation. Empower *anyone* you trust to represent you when you don't vote yourself. ([Learn more](/2016/09/21/what-is-liquid-democracy/).)

Many people, when first learning about liquid democracy, often say something like: "This sounds great. But it must be too hard to make such a change. Passing a constitutional amendment seems impossible."

Right.

But we have a new option open to us.

### We can use the old system to adopt a new one.

We can run new candidates for office. “Liquid Democracy Candidates”.

These are people who believe in this new way, believe in the mission, and want to give their fellow Americans a better way to represent themselves.

Imagine a city council with 15 members. A liquid democracy candidate campaigns for just one of the seats. The other 14 remain the same as before.

They pledge that if elected, they'll vote on each bill according to their district’s liquid democracy.

This could be as easy as pressing a button when their name is called to vote. Their app could perfectly announce their district’s decision, every time:

> Speaker: "Representative Jones, how do you vote?"
>
> (Holding their phone up to the microphone): "The people of district 5 vote NAY!"

In this way, a single district can now democratically choose to [upgrade their representation](/2017/10/27/liquid-democracy-is-not-direct-democracy/). And it only takes 51% of the voters.

**This gives us a grassroots way to bring liquid democracy to our real governments, without any legal changes, with much lower risk than a top-down amendment.**
